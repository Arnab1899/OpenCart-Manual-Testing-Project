# OpenCart-Manual-Testing-Project

To understand and apply the basic manual testing concepts for this demo e-commerce website called OpenCart. The initial FRS document and test plan were already given by the instructor.
Initially I did exploratory testing for better understanding of the website. And read carefully the FRS document and test plan.
Test scenarios and test cases have been prepared.
Before conducting the main testing, sanity and smoke testing have been performed.
After conducting the whole testing, the test case, RTM, and defect report have been developed.
